## Why we to be chosen for help

* We have unique knowledge: we have analyzed more than 250 domain disputes for a long time period. 
* We know actual court practice trends and what factors one should use to claim a huge compensation.
* We regularly share our knowledge with others (by publishing the [articles] and participaiting in [conferences and trainings]).

## Why adminpays?

That's easy. As we discovered, there are plenty of domain disputes, where the domain administrators (instead of the domain owners or with them) were found liable. So, if a court decides a domain admin is liable, awards a compensation (or to pay the damages), this domain admin should pay the money to the plaintiff. Is the admin liable? If so, he pays. Admin pays.
