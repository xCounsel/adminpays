# Conferences and workshops

There are a list of conferences, where we were speakers with our presentations and reports on legal issues related to domain names and domain disputes:

### in English

### [Kardamon: what domain disputes say](https://en.bwforum.ru/conference/intellectual-property2019#rec125640790){:.no-mark-external} 
Here we spoke about the key of success of the Russian and foreign plaintiffs in domain disputes in Russian courts, what foreigners sued in Russia and on what domain names. We also spoke about their trademarks as success factors in such disputes, and who were awarded by courts in huge amount of compensations for violations of their trademark rights. <br/>

During this round table, we spoke on the analysis of the domain disputes in Russia: what domains are the subject of domain disputes, how many disputes related to .RU domain (and why so many), what plaintiffs (from Russia and foreign) were successful and could get compensations in the amount that they claimed for, what factors affected on such amount.

# Courses and trainings

The courses, trainings and educational process are integral part of any legal practice. In part, in collaboration with Legal Academy together, we have prepared a number of training videos on legal issues of domain names disputes in Russia, e.g.:

### ![RU](https://github.com/madebybowtie/FlagKit/raw/master/Assets/PNG/RU.png?raw=true) [Foreign plaintiffs in Russian domain disputes](https://lfacademy.ru/course/2232751){:.no-mark-external}
Discover, what foreign companies and for what domains sued in Russian courts? Who where successful and for what reasons? You can answers on these questions and get other facts. For example, the plaintiffs from the USA are more sucessful than the plaintiffs from Germany.

### [Registrars and disputes](https://lfacademy.ru/course/2658206){:.no-mark-external}
Find out, what the roles the reigstrars play in Russian legal battles, and why the courts do not recognize them liable in respect to domain disputes. Also, this video explains the legal status of a registrar as an information intermediary, what they do to avoid be a defendant and found liable (as a defendant and/or an information intermediary).
