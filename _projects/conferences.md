We regularly participate in different public legal meetings and events both as speakers and an attendees. It helps us to share with our own knowledge and get very useful feedback. 

# Conferences and workshops

There are a list of conferences, where we were speakers with our presentations and reports on legal issues related to domain names and domain disputes:

### in English

[Kardamon: what domain disputes say](https://en.bwforum.ru/conference/intellectual-property2019#rec125640790) <br/>
Here we spoke about the key of success of the Russian and foreign plaintiffs in domain disputes in Russian courts, what foreigners sued in Russia and on what domain names. We also spoke about their trademarks as success factors in such disputes, and who were awarded by courts in huge amount of compensations for violations of their trademark rights.
