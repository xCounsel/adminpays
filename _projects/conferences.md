We regularly participate in different public legal meetings and events both as speakers and an attendees. It helps us to share with our own knowledge and get very useful feedback. 

There are a list of conferences, where we were speakers with our presentations and reports on legal issues related to domain names and domain disputes:
* 2019 - [Protection of Intellectual Property Rights](https://en.bwforum.ru/conference/intellectual-property2019#rec125640790) (Moscow, Russia)
* 2019 - [IT-Lawyers Discussion Club](http://dorotenko.pro/ru/kardamon-report-for-itldc/) (Moscow, Russia)
