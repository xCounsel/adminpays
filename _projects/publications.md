Our articles and publications on legal issues of domain names and domain disputes (mostly held in Russia).

# in English

### [**Domain names disputes: how to get the most compensation in Russian courts**](http://dorotenko.pro/domain-disputes-in-russia-wtr/) 

We analyzed recent Russian court practice on domain disputes and looked at the amount of compensations awarded by courts in favor of plaintiffs. The analysis, based on our [own database](/projects/databases), identifies factors that could directly affect such compensation in Russian courts. <br/>

# in other languages

### [**So Different Domain Disputes. On Compensations**](http://dorotenko.pro/ru/publication-domain-disputes-on-compensation/)

This article as the same above, published in Russian. We verified hypotheses and discovered initially unknown correlations to look more deeply at the Russian domain disputes picture as a whole - including determining the ‘average bill’ for plaintiffs in such cases. <br/>

### [**The "cultural" domain disputes: how the theaters struggle with tickets resellers and the illegal use of their trademarks in the courts**](http://dorotenko.pro/ru/domain-disputes-theatres/)

This article is about legal battles between cultural organizations (theaters, etc.) and the resellers who resell their e-tickets. Here you can find the decisions taken by the courts against domain administrators who mislead users, and what amounts of compensation plaintiffs can expect in such disputes. <br/>

### [Administrators of domain names as the defendants in domain disputes](http://dorotenko.pro/ru/domain-admin-liability/)
In Russia there were a lot of domain disputes, where the individuals (domain owners or administrators) were involved and found liable. We proposed to understand when and for what actions a person (a domain administrator) can be held liable in domain disputes. <br/>

### [Responsibility in 3D: a distributor, a dealer, a domain](http://dorotenko.pro/ru/dealers-and-domains/) 

If an individual enterpreneur or a compnay plans to distribute any product and being at the stage of making the deal under Russian law with its manufacturer, such businessman or legal entity should negotiate a number of legal issues related to domain names. Or else it can be found liable for intellectual property violation of the manufacturer rights by just administering a domain name related to such distribution.
