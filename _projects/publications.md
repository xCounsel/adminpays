The analysis, based on our [own database](/projects/databases.md), identifies factors that could directly affect such compensation in Russian courts. <br/>

### [Administrators of domain names as the defendants in domain disputes](http://dorotenko.pro/ru/domain-admin-liability/)
In Russia there were a lot of domain disputes, where the individuals (domain owners or administrators) were involved and found liable. We proposed to understand when and for what actions a person (a domain administrator) can be held liable in domain disputes. <br/>
