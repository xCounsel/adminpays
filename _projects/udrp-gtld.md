Our ways of legal support also cover gTLD and new gTLDs as well as domain name disputes resolution under the UDRP. We may provide the consulting services related to such issues as well as draft necessary documents (e.g., the UDRP claims).


### The basics of the UDRP, gTLDs, new gTLDs

* TLD means the highest level of a domain name (like ".com" in the adminpays.com domain name) and usually represents its purpose (like how ".aero" is used for the websites related to air companies, flights, etc.). 
* gTLD means general TLD - any TLD with generic purpose (not means the TLD related to any country or region) like as ".com", ".org", ".net", etc.
* new gTLD means a new generic top level domain (gTLD) - like ".berlin", ".club" and any other one that become available under the [ICANN New gTLDs Program](https://newgtlds.icann.org/en/)
* UDRP means Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy. [Here](https://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/guide/) you can find the WIPO guide to the UDRP.

## UDRP

We also provide legal services to participate in the UDRP arbitration. We have a number of successful stories of our employers / clients. For example:
* [UDRP Case No. D2015-0363](../../blog/example/2021-07-27-udrp-d2015-0363.md){:.heading.flip-title}, Yandex LLC v. Whois Privacy Protection Service, Inc. / Svetlana Taisia 
* [UDRP Case No. D2013-1657](../../blog/example/2021-07-23-udrp-d2013-1657){:.heading.flip-title}, YANDEX LLC v. Moniker Privacy Services 

## gTLDs and new gTLDs

For a few years one of our legal counsels [has provided](https://itp.cdn.icann.org/en/files/registry-agreements/yandex/yandex-contacts-16jul14-en.pdf) the legal services for his employer to support its own corporate new gTLD.
