Our legal team are ready to assist you every step of the way to handle and solve a domain name dispute. We can protect your rights and interests since drafting the claim till represent you in a lawsuit related to domain name dispute. We deeply analyze the client's case to find out the gaps and weaknesses in the legal defence of its opponents: not only a domain name owner, but a domain administrator, registrar and hosting company too.

## How we can help

We may be useful in a number of ways to solve a domain name dispute:

* **Draft the complaint and manage it**. A well-composed complaint, what reflects strong points of a claimant, may serve as an effective tool not only to stop the violation, but to get a domain without a court battle. 
* **Draft the lawsuit and provide a court representation**. A more heavily legal tool. If a violator does not react on a complaint, this document can help to force him not only stop the violation, but to pay the damages or a compensation.
* **Calculate the amount of possible compensation**. That's one of our favorite service! If you are filing the lawsuit in Russia, the laws allow you to claim a compensation in a range from 10 000 RUR till 5 000 000 RUR. But try to prove that your amount is adequate and correlates with the violation! We help to do it. By using the [corresponding database](../databases/), we easily and quickly calculate the suitable amount to submit it for the court as a legal basis for the requestem amount of the compensation.
