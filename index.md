More than one year ago I was looking for a blogging platform but couldn't find it:
One that would let me write posts in markdown with my own editor,
one that didn't look awful buy modern design standards, and one that felt snappy on a mobile phone.
That and more is now Hydejack. I hope you enjoy it [as much as I do](https://qwtel.com/).

## First Steps
Start by reading the [Documentation]{:.heading.flip-title}.
Specifically, the chapters below should be relevant now:

* [Install]{:.heading.flip-title} --- How to install and run Hydejack.
* [Config]{:.heading.flip-title} --- Once Jekyll is running you can start with basic configuration.

After you've familiarized yourself with Hydejack, you can delete the following folders and files
containing example content:
