# Have you wished to stop your trademark rights violation by a domain owner?

If so, that's a good idea. But, you are at the begining of the road. In Russia, the laws and current court practice allow you not only to force to terminate the registration of disputed domain name or transfer it to a claimant. But, a claimant also has a right to get a compensation (if a court decision is in his favor):


_**Article 1515. Liability for the Illegal Use of a Trademark:**
4. The right holder is entitled to demand, at his/its option, that the infringer pays compensation instead of reimbursement of damages:
1) in the amount of 10,000 to 5,000,000 roubles at the court's discretion on the basis of the nature of the infringement;_

How much this is in US dollars one can find [here](https://www.xe.com/currencyconverter/convert/?Amount=1&From=RUB&To=USD).
